**Balanced Brackets**

- For each character in the string, if it is an opening bracket(i.e., one of the characters ([, (, {), you push it onto the stack.
- If it is a closing bracket(i.e., one of the characters (}, ),]), you check if the top of the stack contains the corresponding opening bracket.If it does, you pop the opening bracket from the stack and continue iterating through the string. 
- If the stack is empty when you finish iterating through the string, then all the brackets have been balanced, and you can return true.Otherwise, some brackets are unbalanced, and you return false.
